# Web3, Blockchain, Solidity classwork and homeworks from the Oct - Dec 2022 EthDenver Encode Bootcamp :joy: 
(https://github.com/tenkara/solidityHomeworks)
### Contains homeworks and the final Capstone project from the bootcamp

### Week 1 - Primarily in Remix exercising basics of Solidity, create, deploy, interact and transfer using HelloWorld smart contract
### Week 2 - Ballot smart contract tdd, scripts development, deployment of the smart contract to a public blockchain testnet and interaction with group members on various voting related functions of the deployed smart contract

### Week 3 - Building on Week2, creating a tokenized ballot to cast votes, mint tokens, delegate votes, transfer tokens, query results for winning proposal. ** Implemented the homework with my WSD (Working Software Demo) quick feedback loop and rapid iterations approach **
#### Key features
    1. OpenZeppelin Contracts
    2. Operating the contracts with scripts
    3. Testing with TDD and BDD
    4. ERC20Votes, ERC20 Extensions
    5. Smart contracts - Token + Ballot completion, build and execute scripts, Goerli network transactions and interactions

### Week 4 - Created a voting dApp. Learnt about Architecture, design and implementation using Node, Typescript, NestJS framework and API implementation, Swagger UI, Angular and Bootstrap minimal front-end along with several supporting tools to pull it all together.

### Week 5 - Learnt about Gas optimization, overflow/underflow, Smart contract security, Gas limit and loops, updating contracts, using signatures, randomness and Lottery dApp front-end. I took this opportunity to do my own exploration into Signatures, Signers, Transactions and front-end Web3 user interactions

### Week 6 - Blockchain scaling, Layer 2 examples, Solidity advanced content, ECDSA, DeFi, Upgradeability Patterns, iPFS web3 storage, Smart contract security and toolbox.
### Week 7 - Ideation and Sponsor week - Metis, Livepeer, ENS, AltLayer
1. I presented this idea in the class for the final project - ** SmartHealth ** - Building Smart Healthcare using Blockchain and Web3 
2. Found overwhelming interest from a lot of the classmates  
3. Laid out the WSD iterations right away and got to work

### How to fix Angular / Bootstrap issues with environment setup for issues you may face in doing i2 tasks:

### While in the smarthealth-frontend directory in a terminal 
* yarn add or npm install these modules -
  * crypto-browserify stream-browserify assert stream-http https-browserify os-browserify buffer
* Add this in the "CompilerOptions": {[...]} section of tsconfig.json
  * "paths" : {
      "crypto": ["./node_modules/crypto-browserify"],
      "stream": ["./node_modules/stream-browserify"],
      "assert": ["./node_modules/assert"],
      "http": ["./node_modules/stream-http"],
      "https": ["./node_modules/https-browserify"],
      "os": ["./node_modules/os-browserify"],
    }
* Add these lines to /src/polyfills.ts
  * (window as any).global = window;
  * import { Buffer } from 'buffer';
  * window.Buffer = Buffer;
  * (window as any).process = {env: { DEBUG: undefined },};
* Add these lines to compilerOptions block in /src/tsconfig.app.json
  * "types": ["node"]
* Please see my package.json, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, environment.ts for any miscellaneous config related settings or issues and reuse as needed
